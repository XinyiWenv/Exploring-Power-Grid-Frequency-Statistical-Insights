This code is designed to reproduce the results from the paper "Exploring Power Grid Frequency: Statistical Insights" and can be used to test bimodality, linearity, and Markovian behavior for your own data.

The Asian countries analysis and European countries file include a range of code functionalities. These functionalities encompass time series plotting, frequency distribution, and its increments, stationary testing, dip statistics, autocorrelation plotting, as well as the necessary functions for conducting linear tests and detrended fluctuation analysis. Dip statistics and linear test results are saved for future visualization purposes.

The visualising file is used to visualize the location of regions we analysed and results of dip statistics, linear test.

Should you wish to analyze additional datasets, you can seamlessly upload your data and reexecute the entire codebase.
